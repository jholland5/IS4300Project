# IS4300Project
This repository houses example files necessary for the final project in IS4300.  Notice that it should contain a readme file (like this one) to discuss what files are present in the repository.  It should contain the .Rmd file, the data file that the .Rmd file accesses (in this example it is a .csv file), a copy of the report in microsoft word form, and any .R files that were used.
